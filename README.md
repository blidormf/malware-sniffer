# Malware Sniffer

This is a web application that leverages machine learning to detect zero-day malware threats. Users can upload files or provide URLs, and the application will analyze them using advanced machine learning models to determine if they are malicious or benign.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Users can upload files, and the application will calculate the SHA-256 hash of the file to check if it has been analyzed before. If not, it will send the file to a Python script that uses the Malware-SMELL machine learning model for analysis.
- **URL Analysis**: Users can input URLs, which are then sent to a machine learning model powered by the Hugging Face API for analysis.
- **Database Integration**: The application stores the analysis results in a MySQL database, ensuring efficient lookups and avoiding redundant computations.
- **OAuth2 Authentication**: Users can log in using their GitHub accounts via OAuth2 authentication.
- **Commenting System**: Authenticated users can post comments on the application.
